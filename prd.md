# CleanWaterAI - Predicting Water Contamination Risk in Kenyan Water Points - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Overview

Millions of people in rural communities globally, particularly in regions like Kenya, lack access to safe drinking water. Traditional water quality testing is reactive, expensive, and logistically limited. The goal of this project is to build a proactive, AI-powered prediction system that assesses water contamination risk using multi-modal data. The output is surfaced via an interactive dashboard for stakeholders like NGOs, water authorities, and local governments to drive early intervention and improve public health.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Core Objectives (Expanded)

1. **Build a Unified, AI-Driven Contamination Risk Prediction System**:

   * Leverage chemical (GEMS), environmental (GEE + WPDX), and unstructured textual data to provide early warning signals of water contamination.
   * Enable automated risk classification (Safe/Unsafe) for any water point in the region.

2. **Empower Local Decision-Makers with Actionable Insights**:

   * Provide interactive geospatial visualizations, model explanations, and intervention recommendations through a Streamlit dashboard.
   * Allow authorities and NGOs to prioritize field visits, testing, chlorination, and education campaigns.

3. **Fuse Multiple Data Streams to Improve Model Robustness**:

   * Combine structured environmental and chemical data with contextual field reports.
   * Ensure high-coverage predictions even when one data source is sparse or missing.

4. **Deliver Transparency and Trust in AI Models**:

   * Use interpretability tools (SHAP, LIME, PDP) to visualize why a water point is flagged as unsafe.
   * Make feature importance clear to domain experts and non-technical stakeholders.

5. **Automate Monitoring and Model Improvement**:

   * Enable periodic updates using live data pipelines (e.g., CHIRPS rainfall or new WPDX reports).
   * Allow model retraining using fresh contamination labels as new ground truth data is collected.

Each objective is directly tied to a public health need, ensuring that the system is not just technically sound but also impactful in real-world scenarios.

## 3. Data Sources

### 3.1 GEMS (Chemical Water Quality Data)

* Source: GEMStat ([https://gemstat.org/data-gemstat/global-water-quality/](https://gemstat.org/data-gemstat/global-water-quality/))
* Variables:

  * **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)**
  * **Nitrogen (Nitrate, Nitrite, Ammonia)**
  * **Phosphorus**
  * **pH**
* Domain Understanding:

  * Low DO values indicate insufficient oxygen, harmful to ecosystems and indicative of contamination.
  * High nitrogen and phosphorus levels signify fertilizer runoff or sewage, contributing to eutrophication.
  * pH extremes (outside 6.5-8.5) indicate corrosiveness or biological unsuitability.
* Feature Engineering:

  * `do_risk = 1 if DO < 4 mg/L else 0`
  * `n_risk = normalized_score(N_total)` (log or z-scaled)
  * `p_risk = normalized_score(P_total)`
  * `ph_deviation = abs(pH - 7)`
  * Final `chemical_risk_score = weighted_sum([do_risk, n_risk, p_risk, ph_deviation])`

### 3.2 Environmental & Infrastructure Data (WPDX + GEE)

* **WPDX**:

  * Lat/Lon
  * Water source type (borehole, spring, etc.)
  * Status (functional/non-functional)
  * Management type
  * Install year
* **GEE Layers**:

  * **Rainfall** (CHIRPS - past 30 days)
  * **Land Surface Temperature** (MODIS LST - 8-day average)
  * **Vegetation (NDVI)** - Proxy for land use/agricultural activity
* Feature Engineering:

  * `rainfall_30d_sum`
  * `lst_mean`
  * `ndvi_avg`
  * `years_since_installation`
  * `proximity_to_latrines_or_farms` (toxic risk proxy)
* Risk Calculation:

  * Environmental risk is modeled with greater weighting due to broader coverage and temporal resolution.
  * `environmental_risk_score = model(XGBoost or RF on engineered features)`

### 3.3 NLP-derived Text Features (Field Reports, Logs)

* Sources: NGO reports, technician logs, community SMS/self-reports
* Extraction:

  * **Keywords**: diarrhea, stomach, smell, cloudy, broken, rust
  * **TF-IDF vectorization**
  * **Sentiment score** (TextBlob or transformer-based, fine-tuned)
* NLP Feature Engineering:

  * `mentions_smell_flag`, `mentions_illness_flag`
  * `report_sentiment_score`
  * `nlp_risk_score = sigmoid(weighted_sum([flags + sentiment]))`
* NLP plays a supporting role, as text is sparse. Weight in ensemble: \~10%.

## 4. Modeling Approach

### 4.1 Model Structure (CRISP-DM aligned)

* Data Understanding -> Feature Engineering -> Model Selection -> Evaluation -> Deployment

### 4.2 Individual Models

#### A. GEMS Chemical Model

* **Target**: Safe/Unsafe based on thresholds
* **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression (baseline), Random Forest (final)
* **Features**: DO, N, P, pH-deviation
* **Eval**: F1 Score, ROC-AUC

#### B. Environmental Model (WPDX + GEE)

* **Target**: Safe/Unsafe based on status\_id and historic contamination zones
* **Algorithm**: XGBoost (high performance), Random Forest (interpretability)
* **Features**: rainfall, NDVI, LST, years\_since\_install, source type, location
* **Eval**: ROC-AUC > 0.85, F1 > 0.80

#### C. NLP Signal Model

* **Target**: Contamination-flag probability
* **Algorithm**: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression | Optional: BERT embeddings + shallow MLP
* **Features**: Mention flags, keyword scores, sentiment polarity
* **Eval**: Precision @ high risk threshold, recall on true contaminated classes

### 4.3 Ensemble Strategy

* **Weighted Voting Ensemble**:

  * GEMS chemical model: 25%
  * Environmental model: 65%
  * NLP model: 10%
* Final Prediction:

  ```python
  final_risk_score = 0.65 * env_score + 0.25 * chem_score + 0.10 * nlp_score
  label = 'Contaminated' if final_risk_score >= 0.5 else 'Safe'
  ```
* **Interpretability**: SHAP for tree models, LIME for NLP, PDPs to visualize risk vs. feature values

## 7. Conclusion

This PRD outlines a complete pipeline to predict and monitor rural water contamination risks using an ensemble of AI models fed by chemicals, environmental, and text-derived signals. Every feature, from model training to interactive geospatial dashboards, is designed to map directly to a public health objective.

By weighting models appropriately and deploying them via a user-friendly interface, we bridge the gap between technical AI capabilities and lifesaving field action. With data pipelines, explainable models, and real-time alerts, this solution not only predicts contamination but empowers local actors to intervene before crises escalate.

The groundwork is done‚Äîwhat remains is to finalize the modeling notebooks, run evaluations, and feed outputs to Streamlit for impact.

> "Safe water should not wait for a crisis. Predict it, prevent it."
